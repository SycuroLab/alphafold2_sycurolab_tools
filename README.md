The databases have already been installed and are accessible via IMCshared. 

The database paths are set in the alphafold2_sbatch.sh script. 

You only need to change the FASTA_INFILE shell variable for the protein fasta file you want to use. 

The slurm resources are also already in the sbatch slurm batch shell script. 

Can run using sbatch alphafold2_sbatch.sh. Use the instructions in install_alphafold2.txt to install the conda environment. 

The conda environment is also activated in the alphafold2_sbatch.sh script.

Will make a proper README file in the near future. Anyone can message me in slack if they need assistance.
